# Privacy Policy for Coursera Universal Subtitles

**Effective Date: January 3, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how **Coursera Universal Subtitles** handles information.

### 1. Data Collection
We believe in absolute privacy. This Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data, browsing history, or Coursera account information. 

### 2. How it Works
The Extension operates entirely within your local browser. It only reads the subtitle text elements (`.rc-Phrase`) on the `coursera.org` domain to display them in a more readable format over the video player.

### 3. Third-Party Services
We do not share any information with third parties. Translation is handled by your browser's built-in Google Translate feature, not by this extension.

### 4. Contact
If you have any questions, please reach out via the support link on the Chrome Web Store.
